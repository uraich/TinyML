# BLE Thermometer
This directory contains the files needed to run a BlueTooth thermometer,
displayed on a WEB site with a nice thermometer widget.
You will need a ds18b20 digital thermometer connected to your ESP32. It is
however not really difficult to modify the code to use a different type of
thermometer like the SHT30 or the dht11.
To get the WEB page onto the screen, you can either start it with Live Server
or you can simple use a file URL (file:///abs_location_of_your_html_file)
