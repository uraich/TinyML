# TinyML
These are demo programs for a course on TinyML at the University of Cape Coast, Ghana.

The repository is based on the examples in the [tflite micro repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro). There you find the following examples:
* Hello World
* memory_footprint
* mnist_lstm
* network_tester (not used)
* person_detection
* recipes

In addition the _magic wand_ examples from the [TinyML book](https://zlib.pub/book/tinyml-machine-learning-with-tensorflow-lite-on-arduino-and-ultra-low-power-microcontrollers-vshhregc28o0) will be ported to the ESP32.

Please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/uraich/TinyML/wiki). for more information
